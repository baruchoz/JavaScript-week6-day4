// JavaScript Callback Function
/*
    Simply put: A Callback is a function that is to be executed after another
    function has finished its execution - hence the name callback.

    More Complex Definition: In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this,
    functions can take other functions as arguments(parameters), and can return functions
    by other functions.

    Functions that do this are called "higher - Order functions". Any function,
    that is passed as an argument is called a "Callback function".

    SOOOO...why do we need them?

    The reason for this is, because of the JavaScript Event Loop. In a nutshell
    JavaScript is an event driven language so this means, that instead of waiting for 
    a response before moving on, JS will keep executing while listening for other events.

/*
    Though Callbacks give us more functionality...they also introduce
    their own problem: Callback Hell

    Something that looks like this:
    function1( () => {
        function2( () => {
            function3( () => {
                function4( () => {
